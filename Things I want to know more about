I need clarification about the need for the terminal, GitHub, and VS editor.  Don't they all do the same thing? 

Some git commands:  git add ignore - keeps certain files that are private.  

echo "ingnoreme.txt" >> .gitignore.io
cat .gitignore  --->> gitignore website

GST. (what does this mean?)

Make a folder into a repository.
git --version
git --help
git init -? short for initialize (set it up for the first time)
rm -fr .git (removes repository)

Refactoring - changing the code within but not affecting the outside.  

Well, I think I am offically struggling.  I'm going to start over this weekend and try to reclaim my lost work.
