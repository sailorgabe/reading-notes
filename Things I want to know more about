I'm unsure about the need for the terminal,GitHub, and VS editor.  Don't they all do the same thing? 

some git commands:  git add ignore - keeps certain files that are private.  

echo "ingnoreme.txt" >> .gitignore.io
cat .gitignore  --->> gitignore website

gst . (what does this mean?)

make a folder into a repository.
git --version
git --help
git init -? short for intiilaze (set it up for the first time)
rm -fr .git (removes repository)

Refractoring - changing the code within but not effecting the outside.
