## When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

An unordered list should be used when you have a collection of items where the order does not have any specific significance. Think bullet points.

## How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

You can change the bullet style of unordered list items using CSS. The list-style-type property allows you to define the type of bullet you'd like. (source ChatGPT)

## When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

You should use an ordered list (<ol>) when the sequence of the items is important. For instance:

Steps in a recipe.
An agenda or itinerary.
A ranking of items.
On the other hand, as mentioned earlier, an unordered list (<ul>) is used when the order of items is not of particular significance.

## Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

Using the start attribute on the <ol> tag:

You can use the start attribute on the <ol> tag to begin the numbering from a value other than 1:This will display the items starting from the number 5. Using the list-style-type property with CSS:

This property not only works for unordered lists but also for ordered lists. You can change the markers to be different types of numbers or even letters: even Roman numberals! (Source chatGPT)

**The Box Model.**

## Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

Title: The Box Model

Narrator: Once upon a time in the digital realm, there were two characters named Margin and Padding. They lived in the kingdom of Layout, and their roles were essential in shaping the realm.

Margin, an intrepid explorer, was the space that existed between elements. He was like the open space between neighboring towns. You could never find Margin within a town itself, but you'd always encounter him when traveling from one to another. His role was to ensure that each town (or element) had enough room to breathe, maintaining harmony and preventing unwanted clashes. Some towns had vast expanses of Margin, while others preferred to be closer to their neighbors.

Padding, on the other hand, was the trusted guardian of each town's boundaries. Unlike Margin, you would always find Padding inside the town's walls. Padding's duty was to ensure that the town's buildings (or content) had some space from the town's walls (or border). He was like the town's buffer, providing cushioning and ensuring the inner content never felt cramped against the town's protective barriers.

Narrator: As the story unfolds, our main character, a box named "Elementa," embarks on a journey to find her perfect size and space. She visits the great tailor "CSS" to get her design done.

Elementa: "Sir, I feel too close to my content! Can you help?"

Padding: "Fear not! I'll give you some space on the inside, ensuring your content has room to breathe."

And with that, Padding expanded, pushing Elementa's content away from her borders.

Elementa: "Thank you, Padding. But, oh dear! Now I'm too close to my neighboring boxes. It feels crowded!"

Margin: "Leave it to me." Margin stepped in, creating space around Elementa, ensuring she didn't collide or get too close to other elements.

Narrator: With the combined efforts of Margin and Padding, Elementa found her perfect space, both inside and out. The kingdom of Layout thrived in harmony, with every box feeling comfortable in its place, thanks to the unsung heroes of "The Box Model."

In this story, Margin and Padding are portrayed as characters that ensure elements have their desired space both internally and externally, reflecting their roles in the CSS Box Model.

## List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

The CSS Box Model describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree and laid out according to the visual formatting model. The Box Model comprises four parts:

**Content:**

**Description:** This is the area where your actual content resides. It could be text, images, or any other media.
Property: The size of the content area is determined by the content itself and can be controlled using the width and height properties for block-level elements.
Padding:

**Description:** Padding is the space between the content of the element and its border. It acts as a cushion around the content.
Property: You can control the padding using the padding property and its related properties (padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left).
Border:

**Description:** The border surrounds the padding (if any) and content. It acts as a fence or wall, delineating the boundaries of the box. It can be styled in various ways regarding color, style (e.g., solid, dashed), and width.
Property: The border is controlled using the border property and its related properties (border-width, border-style, border-color, and their respective individual sides like border-top-width, border-right-color, etc.).
Margin:

**Description:** Margin is the space outside the border. It separates the element from its neighbors, ensuring there's space between different elements. Unlike the other parts of the box model, the margin area is transparent.
Property: The margin can be adjusted using the margin property and its related properties (margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left).

When styling and designing layouts in CSS, understanding how these four parts interact is crucial. The total space an element occupies on the page is the sum of these components.

**Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops**

## What data types can you store inside of an Array?

In JavaScript, arrays are versatile, and you can store any data type inside them. This includes:

**Primitive Data Types:**

Numbers (e.g., 5, 3.14)
Strings (e.g., "hello", 'world')
Booleans (e.g., true, false)
undefined
null
Symbols (a unique and immutable data type introduced in ES6)
BigInt (an arbitrary-precision integer, introduced in ES11)

**Reference Data Types:**

Objects (including plain objects, functions, arrays, etc.)
Other arrays (i.e., you can have nested arrays or multidimensional arrays) (source Chat GPT)

## Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

Yes, people is a valid JavaScript array. The array people contains other arrays (making it a 2D or two-dimensional array), and these inner arrays have a mix of data types: strings, numbers, and null.

Since people is a 2D array, you'll use two indices to access a specific value. The first index will access the outer array, and the second index will access the inner array.

If you want to loop through all the people and their details, you can use nested loops or other iteration methods.This will print all the details for each person one by one.(chatGPT)

## List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

+=: Addition Assignment

This operator adds the right operand to the left operand and then assigns the result to the left operand.

-=: Subtraction Assignment

This operator subtracts the right operand from the left operand and then assigns the result to the left operand.

*=: Multiplication Assignment

This operator multiplies the left operand by the right operand and then assigns the result to the left operand.

/=: Division Assignment

This operator divides the left operand by the right operand and then assigns the result to the left operand.

%=: Remainder (or Modulus) Assignment

This operator calculates the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand and then assigns the result to the left operand.

All of these shorthand operators help reduce the amount of code needed for common mathematical assignments, making the code more concise and easier to read. (source ChatGPT)

## Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

Let's break down the expression (a + c) + b; step by step:

Values of the Variables:

a has a value of 10.
b has a value of 'dog'.
c has a value of false.
Evaluating (a + c):

You're adding a number (a which is 10) and a boolean (c which is false).
In JavaScript, when a boolean is involved in a mathematical operation, it gets coerced into a number. The value true becomes 1, and the value false becomes 0.
Therefore, c (which is false) becomes 0.
So, a + c becomes 10 + 0, which is 10.
Evaluating the Result of the Above with + b:

Now, you're adding the number 10 (result of a + c) with the string 'dog' (value of b).
In JavaScript, when you try to add a number to a string, the number gets coerced into a string, and then string concatenation occurs.
So, 10 becomes the string '10', and when concatenated with 'dog', it becomes '10dog'.
Given the above steps, the result of the expression (a + c) + b; would be the string '10dog'. (source ChatGPT)

## Describe a real-world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

A conditional statement can help users pick certain things like loyalty points, membership status, or first-time shoppers. Conditional statements allow businesses to group or provide perks to different people depending on their status.

## Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

Loops are essential in such scenarios where repetitive tasks need to be executed on multiple items, like displaying a series of posts, products, images, or any collection of similar items on a webpage. In the context of web development, loops often work in tandem with the DOM to dynamically generate and render content based on data structures like arrays or objects. (chatGPT)
