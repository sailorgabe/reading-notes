# Gabriel's Code Fellow Reading Notes
 
**My Code Fellows reading notes**

My name is Gabriel Urquidez.  I retired from the Navy in 2022. I have utilized VETTEC to fund my new career change into software engineering. I am happily married with three girls. We are moving back home to the California Bay Area in December.  My goal is to land a good-paying job and raise my girls back home.  

This site is about notes for Code Fellows.

***Growth Mindset*** is about understanding that change is hard, but keeping a positive mindset and accepting that coding is not easy. Understand that it will take time, but you just have to work at it.

3 Reminders:

1. Fail fast and fail often.

1. It's ok to feel uncomfortable.

1. Ask for help!!
