# My Code Fellow Reading Notes
 
**My Code Fellows reading notes**

My name is Gabriel Urquidez.  I retired from the Navy in 2022. I have utilized VETTEC to fund my new career change into software engineering. I am happily married with 3 girls. We are moving back home to the California Bay Area in Decemeber.  My goal is to land a good paying job and raise my girls back home.  

This site is about notes for Code Fellows. 

#0969DA Growth Mindset is about understanding that change is hard, but to keep a positive mindset and accept that coding is not easy. Understand that it will take time but you just have to work at it. 

3 Reminders:

<sub>subscript</sup>1. Fail fast and fail often.

<sub>subscript</sup>2. It's ok to feel uncomfortable.

<sub>subscript</sup>3. Ask for help!!
